This will be done by comparing the value to the maximum and minumum for the category to compute its relative position. The resulting value will then get scaled to the 0-25 scale and the scores from each category will then be summed to create a final \"buy score\". By comparing the buy scores across all stocks, we can see which are the best opportunities to deploy our available money."
